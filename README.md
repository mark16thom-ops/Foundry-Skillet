# Foundry-Skillet
🍳 Cast Iron Skillet Casting Project
Overview

This project documents the process of creating a cast iron skillet using the cope and drag sand casting method. A provided skillet pattern and resin-coated sand molds were used to form the mold, followed by molten cast iron pouring, cooling, and post-casting finishing to produce a functional cast iron skillet.

🧰 Materials and Equipment

Cope and Drag (casting frames)

Cast Iron Skillet Pattern

Resin-Coated Sand

Wooden Block (Riser)

Parting / Release Agent

Pressurized Air (for mold cleaning)

Adhesive Mold Glue

Molten Cast Iron

Sand Pit

Metal Saw

Grinder

🏗️ Process Steps
Mold Preparation

Placed the skillet pattern into the cope and filled it with resin-coated sand.

Rammed and flattened the sand to ensure it filled all details and cavities of the pattern.

Allowed the sand to cure for approximately 3 minutes and 30 seconds.

Carefully flipped the cope and removed the hardened mold from the pattern.

Repeated the process for the drag, placing a wooden block to act as the riser.

After curing, knocked out the pattern from the drag mold.

Mold Cleaning and Assembly

Used pressurized air to remove any loose sand from both mold halves.

Applied a strong adhesive around the rim of the cope mold.

Aligned and placed the cope on top of the drag, ensuring the riser hole was properly aligned to allow molten metal flow.

Transferred the completed mold to the sand pit in preparation for pouring.

Metal Pouring and Casting

Instructors poured superheated molten cast iron into the mold through the riser system.

Allowed the casting to cool and solidify for approximately 36 hours.

Broke open the sand mold and carefully removed the cast iron skillet.

Finishing

Removed excess material using a metal saw.

Ground down sharp edges and remaining fragments with a grinder to produce a smooth and safe finish.

🍳 Final Product

The final product is a solid cast iron skillet, produced using traditional foundry sand-casting techniques. This project demonstrates proper mold preparation, riser placement, metal pouring, cooling control, and post-casting finishing methods commonly used in industrial foundry operations.
